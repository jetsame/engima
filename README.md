 Functional transfer in Python.
 
 Enigma is a portable encryption machine used to encrypt and decrypt secret messages. More precisely, Enigma is a whole family of electromechanical rotary machines that have been used since the 20s of the XX century. The main task was to create a program with which you can encode and decode words. Link to useful articles on Habr, Wikipedia, which explains the structure of the crypto machine:

# How to use Encoder :
  Remember position of rotors (3 values). Write the word you need. Send your friend the word and 3 values.
 
# How to use Decoder :
  Enter 3 values for position of rotors (random1, random2, random3). Enter a word in a function argument.
